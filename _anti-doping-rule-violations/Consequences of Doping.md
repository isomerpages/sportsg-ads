#### Consequences of Doping

Usage of Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods may result in very severe health consequences, as well as sporting, financial, legal and social consequences.

<u><b>Physical and Mental Health</b></u>  
Physical Health: Depending on the substance, the dosage and the consumption frequency, doping products may have particularly negative side effects on health. Some damages for the body are irreversible and may put oneâ€™s life in great danger.

Mental Health: Some doping substances may not be detrimental to the body but exercise an impact on mental health. It has been scientifically evidenced that anxiety, obsessive disorders or psychosis are direct consequences from doping.

#### Social Consequences  
The existence of an athlete who was charged as guilty for doping may be completely disrupted. Other than health consequences, it may also be prejudicial to the fame, respect and creditworthiness. Even in the future, negative findings are regularly questioned by the media and the entourage. The damage to the reputation will remain in the collective unconscious and the athlete could remain isolated.

<u><b>Financial Consequences</b></u>  
In elite sport, an infringement of anti-doping rules often leads to a loss of income, the reimbursement of prize moneys and even the sponsorship money. An athlete suspended for several years, or even banned for life, cannot earn his/her living as usual and can even be forced into debt to live on a day-to-day basis.

<u><b>Sporting Consequences</b></u>  
A doping violation may mean loss of results, rankings, medals and qualification places at events. It could also have an impact on members of the same team, causing medals to be lost.

<u><b>Legal Consequences</b></u>  
Doping may have major legal consequences. A sanctioned athlete may not take part in sport competition or in organized training sessions.

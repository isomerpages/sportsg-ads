### **Education**

To achieve its vision that *"Every Singaporean Athlete is a True Winner"*, one of the key strategies of Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) is through Clean Sport Education.

It is through our education programmes that ADS aims to:
* Promote clean sport behaviour that positively influence athletes' beliefs, attitudes and behaviour toward doping in sport; and
* Create a generation of athletes and athlete support personnel who understand the values of competing fairly and cleanly.

Targeted at athletes competing at all levels and their support personnel, our education initiatives include:
* Workshops for elite athletes to inform them of their anti-doping responsibilities and provide a range of relevant and up-to-date information so that they make informed and responsible decisions and reduce the risk of inadvertent doping.
* Workshops for athlete support personnel to provide a range of relevant and up-to-date information that will help them understand the importance of clean sport and empower them to help athletes make informed and responsible decisions about the misuse of prohibited substances or methods.
* Outreach sessions to educate youth athletes about their anti-doping responsibilities in a fun and interactive manner.

To achieve this, ADS works closely with the various National Sports Associations and the sports fraternity so that athletes enjoy the right to clean sport in Singapore.

#### **PRINCIPLES &amp; VALUES ASSOCIATED  WITH CLEAN SPORT**

The basic principle for information and education programmes shall be to protect the spirit of sport from being undermined by doping and to establish an environment which promotes ad encourages clean sport behaviour and conduct among Participants.

The primary goal shall be to educate and inform Athletes, Athlete Support Personnel and other Persons about issues concerning doping in sport, and the risks of inadvertent doping.

ADS will assist NSAs in the planning, implementation and monitoring of information and education programmes on clean sport for their Athletes, Athlete Support Personnel and other Persons. The programmes should provide Participants with updated and accurate information on various issues, including:

* Substances and methods on the Prohibited List;
* Health consequences of doping;
* Sample collection procedures; and
* Athlete's rights and responsibilities
* Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRVs)
* Any other education contents

All NSAs and Athlete Support Personnel have a responsibility to educate and counsel Athletes on the principles and values of Clean Sport, and the ADS Rules.

ADS, NSAs and Participants shall cooperate with each other and the Singapore Government to coordinate their efforts in anti-doping information and education.

ADS will also promote and seek to collaborate with the relevant Singapore Government departments to implement and monitor information and education programmes on Clean Sport for society in general.

#### **ANTI-DOPING EDUCATION &amp; LEARNING (ADEL)**

The basic principle for information and education programmes shall be to support the preservation of the spirit of sport, as outlined in the World Anti-Doping Code, and to help foster a Clean Sport environment. The International Standard for Education (ISE) is a mandatory International Standard developed as part of the World Anti-Doping program. As underpinning principle of the ISE is that an athlete's first experience with anti-doping should be through education rather doping control.

The [Anti-Doping Education &amp; Learning (ADEL)](https://adel.wada-ama.org/learn/external-ecommerce) is a global learning platform by WADA that provides education and learning opportunities for athletes and athletes support personnel.

**RESEARCH**     
Understanding the fundamental differences between athletes who choose to compete clean and those who resort to doping or why some athletes decided to dope will help ensure doping prevention strategies are effective and efficient.   
The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) Social Science Research Grant Program was created to ensure that preventive anti-doping education programs were designed using an evidence-based approach.

Annual research grant funding of between USD 20,000 to USD 65,000 are available to organizations keen on research projects that can contribute to doping prevention.

More details on the [WADA Social Science Research Grant Program](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/data-research/social-science-research) can be found at the WADA website.
